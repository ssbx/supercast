# in the future
- lock on subscribe rationalize (channel,client,loggers) and document. Actualy
a channel will block wile it is synchronizing a client. It is possible to not
block, but it vastly increase code complexity for supercast_logger,
ssl/tcp_client and supercast_channel modules.
- XML  encoder support,
- JSON encoder support,
- Websocket/secure Websocket support,
- Behaviour in a distributed environment with multiple supercast servers
running?

- TailSql, SQL support: one channel per table. Use the postgresql notify function to
generate events. Allow the creation of complete applications in plsql from
server, and javascript for client.
