-callback get_perms(PidName::atom()) -> #perm_conf{}.
% @doc
% The module implementing supercast_channel behaviour must return the #perm_conf{}
% defining the authorisation to subscribe to him.
% Triggered on a client call to sync_request, supercast define if the user
% is allowed and continue or stop subscription process.
% @end

-callback sync_request(PidName::atom(), CState::#client_state{}) -> ok.
% @doc
% This call is triggered when a client allowed to subscribe to the channel.
% - The sync_request must include a supercast_channel:subscribe/2 if the channel want
% to forward future messages to the client. 
% - It can also dump the channel state using the 
% ClientState#client_state.module:send/2
% Note that these two actions must be done in a single
% call (gen_server:cast, gen_fsm:send_event) for a perfect synchronisation.
% You must use a asynchronous call to not block the supercast_mpd during
% the sync.
